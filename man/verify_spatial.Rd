\arguments{
\item{start_date}{Date of the first forecast to read.}

\item{end_date}{Date of the last forecast to read.}

\item{det_model}{The name of the deterministic model. Maybe expressed as a
vector if more than one model is wanted.}

\item{parameter}{The parameters to read as a character vector.}

\item{lead_time}{The lead times to read as a numeric vector.}

\item{by}{The time between forecasts. Should be a string of a number followed
by a letter, where the letter gives the units - may be d for days, h for
hours or m for minutes.}

\item{fc_file_path}{The top level path for the forecast files to read.}

\item{fc_file_template}{The file type to generate the template for. Can be
"harmoneps_grib", "harmeoneps_grib_fp", "harmoneps_grib_sfx", "meps_met",
"harmonie_grib", "harmonie_grib_fp", "harmone_grib_sfx", "vfld", "vobs", or
"fctable". If anything else is passed, it is returned unmodified. In this
case substitutions can be used. Available substitutions are {YYYY} for
year, \{MM\} for 2 digit month with leading zero, \{M\} for month with no
leading zero, and similarly \{DD\} or \{D\} for day, \{HH\} or \{H\} for
hour, \{mm\} or \{m\} for minute. Also \{LDTx\} for lead time and \{MBRx\}
for ensemble member where x is the length of the string including leading
zeros - can be omitted or 2, 3 or 4. Note that the full path to the file
will always be file_path/template.}

\item{fc_file_format}{The format of the files to read. Can be e.g. "fa" or "grib".}

\item{fc_options}{A list with format-specific options for the reader function.}

\item{fc_interp_method}{Interpolation method to be used when transforming a forecast
field to the verification grid.}

\item{fc_accumulation}{The accumulation type of the forecast. This is only used for
accumulated parameters (e.g. precipitation). NULL signifies that the field is accumulated
from the start of the model run. Otherwise this should be a string containing a numerical value
and a time unit, e.g. "15m" or "1h".}

\item{ob_file_path}{The top level path for the forecast files to read.}

\item{ob_file_template}{The file type to generate the template for. Can be
"harmoneps_grib", "harmeoneps_grib_fp", "harmoneps_grib_sfx", "meps_met",
"harmonie_grib", "harmonie_grib_fp", "harmone_grib_sfx", "vfld", "vobs", or
"fctable". If anything else is passed, it is returned unmodified. In this
case substitutions can be used. Available substitutions are {YYYY} for
year, \{MM\} for 2 digit month with leading zero, \{M\} for month with no
leading zero, and similarly \{DD\} or \{D\} for day, \{HH\} or \{H\} for
hour, \{mm\} or \{m\} for minute. Also \{LDTx\} for lead time and \{MBRx\}
for ensemble member where x is the length of the string including leading
zeros - can be omitted or 2, 3 or 4. Note that the full path to the file
will always be file_path/template.}

\item{ob_file_format}{The format of the files to read. Can be e.g. "hdf5" or "grib".}

\item{ob_options}{A list with format-specific options for the reader function.}

\item{ob_interp_method}{Interpolation method to be used when transforming a forecast
field to the verification grid.}

\item{ob_accumulation}{The accumulation type of the observation (or reference). This is only used for
accumulated parameters (e.g. precipitation). NULL signifies that the field is accumulated
from the start of the model run. That is probably rare for observations. 
Otherwise this should be a string containing a numerical value
and a time unit, e.g. "15m" or "1h". "0" means an instantaneous value.}

\item{verif_domain}{A \code{geodomain} that defines the common verification grid.}

\item{box_sizes}{Scales used for fuzzy methods like FSS. A vector of box sizes.
All values must be odd integers (so the central point is really in the center of a box).}

\item{thresholds}{Thresholds used for FSS, ...}

\item{sqlite_path}{If specified, SQLite files are generated and written to
this directory.}

\item{sqlite_file}{Name of SQLite file.}

\item{return_data}{If TRUE, the result is returned as a list of tables.}

\item{...}{Not used at thispoint (more info to be added).}

A list containting tibbles for all scores.
